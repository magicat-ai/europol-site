# EUROPOL Content Framework

## Writing Principles

### Voice & Tone
- **Authoritative but empathetic**: We understand people come to us in difficult moments
- **Professional, never salesy**: Like a trusted advisor, not a vendor
- **Clear and direct**: No jargon, no fluff, respect the reader's time
- **Confident without arrogance**: 60+ years of experience speaks for itself

### Target Reader Psychology
- They're often in emotional distress (suspicion, betrayal, business crisis)
- They need reassurance that this is the RIGHT decision
- They worry about: discretion, legality, cost, effectiveness
- They want to feel understood, not judged
